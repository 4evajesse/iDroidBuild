# iDroidBuild
The Build With Assets And Scripts For My Project

The purpose of this simulation/game was to showcase my skills as a software developer. This was made within a process of 4 days using the Unity Engine mixed with C# scripts and therefore published onto both GameJolt and Simmer.io.

- Rotate Left and Right: Rotates the drone 90 degrees either to the left or to the right.
- Report: Shows the location of the drone.
